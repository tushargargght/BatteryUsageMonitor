=> Tried using adb shell dumpsys batterystats. Dump requires SystemOrSigned permission level [3]

=> Though dumbsys batterystats contains per app power usage directly. [check batterystats.txt Line:10290]

=> An app’s consumption depends on the hardware resources it uses, how long it uses them for, how often they’re used, and how hard they’re pushed. Thats how Android natively does it. [1]

=> Tried giving permission through adb but didn't work. [4]

Conclusion:
According to me, need to do it the same way android does it. That is calculating the resources each app used and thus obtaining power integrating over all the resources.
